/**
 * tmux -CC command-block correlator (tc-82a).
 *
 * This module provides the CORRELATION layer on top of the token stream emitted
 * by `ControlTokenizer` (tc-ckw). It matches each %begin…%end/%error block to
 * the outstanding command that produced it.
 *
 * # Protocol model
 *
 * The client sends commands; tmux replies with command blocks:
 *
 *   %begin  <ts> <cmdnum> <flags>   ← block open
 *   <body lines>                     ← arbitrary bytes (may start with %)
 *   %end    <ts> <cmdnum> <flags>   ← success  (or)
 *   %error  <ts> <cmdnum> <flags>   ← failure
 *
 * Command numbers increase monotonically. Replies arrive in FIFO order
 * (tmux guarantees this). Between blocks, tmux may emit notification lines
 * (%output, %window-add, etc.) that are unrelated to any command.
 *
 * # Correlation strategy
 *
 * This correlator maintains a FIFO queue of pending commands registered by the
 * caller. On `%end`/`%error` it dequeues the OLDEST pending entry and resolves
 * it. As an additional safety check it also verifies that the closing
 * `commandNumber` matches the expected one (it always should per protocol, but
 * if a mismatch is detected the correlator rejects rather than silently
 * mis-correlates).
 *
 * # API overview
 *
 * ```ts
 * const corr = new CommandCorrelator({
 *   onNotification(token) { /* forward to downstream * / },
 * });
 *
 * // When the caller is about to send a command to tmux, register it first:
 * const result: Promise<CommandResult> = corr.expectCommand();
 *
 * // Feed tokens as they arrive from ControlTokenizer:
 * for (const token of tokenizer.push(chunk)) {
 *   corr.push(token);
 * }
 *
 * // The Promise resolves once the matching %end or %error block is complete.
 * const { ok, commandNumber, body } = await result;
 * ```
 *
 * # Thread safety / concurrency
 *
 * `CommandCorrelator` is single-threaded (synchronous push; Promise resolution
 * is microtask-deferred). It has no internal timers or I/O. All state mutation
 * happens inside `push()` calls on the caller's event loop.
 *
