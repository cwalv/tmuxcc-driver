/**
 * @tmuxcc/broker — public API.
 *
 * Primary entry point: `createBroker({ socketName, runtimeDir? })`.
 * Returns a BrokerHandle with `start()`, `shutdown()`, `endpoint()`.
 *
 * The broker is a per-tmux-socket discovery and lifecycle service:
 *   - Maintains the list of sessions on a tmux socket
 *   - Spawns per-session daemon processes on demand
 *   - Hands clients daemon socket paths via the broker wire
 *
 * See SCHEMA.md "Broker wire" for the full wire protocol spec.
 *
 * Assumption on lifecycle supervision:
 * The broker does not manage its own auto-spawn or OS-level supervision.
 * Per SCHEMA.md "Broker lifecycle", process supervision is out of scope for v3.
 * A launcher binary (Stage 3+) is needed for production autospawn.
